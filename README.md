The **Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI** aims to accelerate the development, management and automation of Azure IoT solutions. It does this via addition of rich features and functionality to the official [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure).

## News

- ❗ When upgrading your Azure CLI core version, for the best experience and to avoid breaking changes, we recommend updating your `azure-iot` extension to the [latest available](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension/releases).

- Azure CLI `2.24.0` requires an `azure-iot` extension update to `0.10.11` or later for IoT Hub commands to work properly. However **we recommend** at least `azure-iot` `0.10.14`. Updating the extension can be done with `az extension update --name azure-iot`.

> Note: A common error that arises when using an older `azure-iot` with Azure CLI `2.24.0+` shows as follows: `AttributeError: 'IotHubResourceOperations' object has no attribute 'config'`.

- Starting with version `0.10.13` of the IoT extension, you will need an Azure CLI core version of `2.17.1` or higher. IoT extension version `0.10.11` remains on the extension index to support environments that cannot upgrade core CLI versions.

- The legacy IoT extension Id `azure-cli-iot-ext` is deprecated in favor of the new modern Id `azure-iot`. `azure-iot` is a superset of `azure-cli-iot-ext` and any new features or fixes will apply to `azure-iot` only. Also the legacy and modern IoT extension should **never** co-exist in the same CLI environment.

    Uninstall the legacy extension with the following command: `az extension remove --name azure-cli-iot-ext`.

    Related - if you see an error with a stacktrace similar to:

    ```text
    ...
    azure-cli-iot-ext/azext_iot/common/_azure.py, ln 90, in get_iot_hub_connection_string
        client = iot_hub_service_factory(cmd.cli_ctx)
    cliextensions/azure-cli-iot-ext/azext_iot/_factory.py, ln 29, in iot_hub_service_factory
        from azure.mgmt.iothub.iot_hub_client import IotHubClient
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'azure.mgmt.iothub.iot_hub_client'
    ```

    The resolution is to remove the deprecated `azure-cli-iot-ext` and install any version of the `azure-iot` extension.

## Commands

Please refer to the official `az iot` reference on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot) for a complete list of supported commands.  You can also find IoT CLI usage tips on the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension/wiki/Tips).

## Installation

1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - You must have at least `v2.3.1`, which you can verify with `az --version`
1. Add, Update or Remove the IoT extension with the following commands:
    - Add: `az extension add --name azure-iot`
    - Update: `az extension update --name azure-iot`
    - Remove: `az extension remove --name azure-iot`

Please refer to the [Installation Troubleshooting Guide](docs/install-help.md) if you run into any issues or the [Alternative Installation Methods](docs/alt-install-methods.md) if you'd like to install from a GitHub release or local source.

## Usage

After installing the Azure IoT extension your CLI environment is augmented with the addition of `hub`, `central`, `dps`, `dt`, `edge` and `device` commands.

For usage and help content of any command or command group, pass in the `-h` parameter. Root command group details are shown for the following IoT services.
