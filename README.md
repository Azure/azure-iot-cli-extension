![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/azure-cli.svg?maxAge=2592000)
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-iot-cli-extension/_apis/build/status/Merge%20-%20Azure.azure-iot-cli-extension?branchName=dev)](https://dev.azure.com/azure/azure-iot-cli-extension/_build/latest?definitionId=49&branchName=dev)

The **Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI** aims to accelerate the development, management and automation of Azure IoT solutions. It does this via addition of rich features and functionality to the official [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure).

## Commands

Please refer to the official `az iot` reference on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ext/azure-iot/iot?view=azure-cli-latest) for a complete list of supported commands.  You can also find IoT CLI usage tips on the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension/wiki/Tips).

## Installation

1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - You must have at least `v2.0.70`, which you can verify with `az --version`
1. Add, Update or Remove the IoT extension with the following commands:
    - Add: `az extension add --name azure-iot`
    - Update: `az extension update --name azure-iot`
    - Remove: `az extension remove --name azure-iot`

Please refer to the [Installation Troubleshooting Guide](docs/install-help.md) if you run into any issues or the [Alternative Installation Methods](docs/alt-install-methods.md) if you'd like to install from a GitHub release or local source.

## Usage

After installing the Azure IoT extension your CLI environment is augmented with the addition of `central`, `device`, `dps`, `dt`, `edge`, `hub` and `pnp` commands.

For usage and help content for any command or command group, pass in the `-h` parameter, for example:

```
$ az iot hub -h
