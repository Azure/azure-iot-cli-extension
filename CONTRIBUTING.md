## Dev Setup

1. Get Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Required Repositories

You must fork and clone the repositories below. Follow the videos and instructions found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-dev-tools#setting-up-your-development-environment).

1. https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli

2. https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension

> IMPORTANT: When cloning the repositories and environments, ensure they are all siblings to each other. This makes things much easier down the line.

```text
source-directory/
|-- azure-cli/
|-- azure-iot-cli-extension/
|-- .env3/
```

> IMPORTANT: Ensure you keep the Python virtual environment you created above. It is required for development.

After following the videos, ensure you have:

1. Python virtual environment

2. Functional development az cli

#### Environment Variables

You can run this setup in `bash` or `cmd` environments, this documentation just show the `powershell` flavor.

1. Create a directory for your development extensions to live in

    ```powershell
    mkdir path/to/source/extensions/azure-iot
    ```

2. Set `AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR` to the following

    ```powershell
    $env:AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR="path/to/source/extensions"
    ```

#### azdev Steps

Similar to the video, have your virtual environment activated then execute the following command

```powershell
(.env3) azdev setup -c path/to/source/azure-cli
```

#### Install dev extension

1. Change directories

    ```powershell
    cd path/to/source/azure-iot-cli-extension
    ```

2. Install the extension (should only be needed once)

    ```powershell
    pip install -U --target path/to/source/extensions/azure-iot .
    ```

#### Verify environment is setup correctly

Run a command that is present in the iot extension space

```powershell
az iot central app -h
```

If this works, then you should now be able to make changes to the extension and have them reflected immediately in your az cli.

## Unit and Integration Testing

Tests are organized into folders by resource in `azext_iot\tests\`:
- Central
- Digital Twins
- Device Provisioning Service
- IoT Hub
- Product
- Utility

### Unit Tests

You may need to install the dev_requirements for this

```powershell
pip install -r path/to/source/dev_requirements
```

Example unit tests runs:

_Hub:_
`pytest azext_iot/tests/iothub/core/test_iot_ext_unit.py`

_DPS:_
`pytest azext_iot/tests/dps/core/test_dps_discovery_unit.py`

Unit tests end in "_unit.py" so execute the following command to run all unit tests,
`pytest -k "_unit.py"`

Execute the following command to run the IoT Hub unit tests:

`pytest azext_iot/tests/iothub/ -k "_unit.py"`

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are run against Azure resources and depend on environment variables.

Example int tests runs:

_Hub:_
`pytest azext_iot/tests/iothub/core/test_iothub_storage_int.py`

_DPS:_
`pytest azext_iot/tests/dps/core/test_dps_discovery_int.py`

Integration tests end in "_int_.py" so execute the following command to run all integration tests,
`pytest -k "_int_.py"`

Execute the following command to run the IoT Hub integration tests:

`pytest azext_iot/tests/iothub/ -k "_int_.py"`

#### Azure Resource Setup

The following resources will be needed for the integration tests.

- IoT Hub
- IoT Device Provisioning Service
- Azure Digital Twins instance
- IoT Central App
- Storage Account (with an empty Container)
- Event Grid Topic
- Event Hub Namespace with an Event Hub
- Service Bus Namespace with a Topic
- Azure Data Explorer Cluster with a Database

If specified in the pytest.ini configuration file, those resources will be used. Please ensure that the resources are in a clean, new state (ex: Iot Hub should not have any devices). Otherwise, new resources will be generated during the test startup and deleted during the test teardown.

> Note: If you interrupt test execution (for example via ctrl + C), the teardown or clean up processes may not run leaving resources in an indeterminant state.

#### Integration Test Environment Variables

You can either manually set the environment variables or use the `pytest.ini.example` file in the root of the extension repo. To use that file, rename it to `pytest.ini`, open it and set the variables as indicated below.

```
    AZURE_TEST_RUN_LIVE=True
    azext_iot_testrg=
    azext_iot_testhub=
    azext_iot_testdps=
    azext_iot_teststorageaccount=
    azext_iot_teststoragecontainer=
    azext_iot_central_app_id=
    azext_iot_central_scope_id=
    azext_iot_central_primarykey=
    azext_iot_central_storage_cstring=
    azext_iot_central_storage_container=
    azext_dt_adx_cluster=
    azext_dt_adx_database=
    azext_dt_adx_rg=
    azext_dt_ep_eventgrid_topic=
    azext_dt_ep_servicebus_namespace=
    azext_dt_ep_servicebus_policy=
    azext_dt_ep_servicebus_topic=
    azext_dt_ep_eventhub_namespace=
    azext_dt_ep_eventhub_policy=
    azext_dt_ep_eventhub_topic=
    azext_dt_ep_eventhub_topic_consumer_group=
    azext_dt_ep_rg=
    azext_dt_region=
```

To run almost all of the tests, only the `azext_iot_testrg` is needed.

To run all tests, `azext_iot_testrg`, `azext_iot_central_app_id`, and `azext_iot_central_primarykey` are needed because the IoT Central Primary Key cannot be currently retrieved through the CLI.

For all resources, if the environmental variable is not provided, a new instance will be created for the test run and deleted at the end of the test run.

| Variable name 	| Tests Used for 	| Description 	|
|---------------	|----------------	|-------------	|
| `az_iot_testrg`  	|    All          	| The resource group that contains the IoT Hub and DPS instances or where all test resources are created. It will be the default resource group if any other resource group variables are not provided.	|

##### IoT Central

IoT Central integration tests can be run against a specific available api versions using command line argument "--api-version"

e.g. run tests against v 1.0

`pytest azext_iot/tests/central/ -k "_int.py" --api-version "1.0"`

If the "--api-version" argument is not specified, all runs act against default api version for each tested command.

##### Test Resource Tagging

There are 4 more test variables used for tagging the test resources:
- `use_tags`
- `definition_id`
- `job_display_name`
- `job_id`

If `use_tags` is set to "True", then the resources created and used in Iot Central, DPS, and Hub tests will be tagged. The tested resources (IoT Hub, DPS, and Central App instances) will have two types of tags:
- number of test method runs (ex: `test_central_device_c2d_purge_success : 1` means that the test "test_central_device_c2d_purge_success" was run once)
- a pipeline name or id (ex: `pipeline_id : 00 Test IoT Central Python310 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000` generated from internal pipeline runs) which can be manually set with `definition_id`, `job_display_name` and `job_id`.

Other resources created for these tests (ex: Storage Accounts for IoT Hub and Central tests) will have tags showing which test resource is associated (ex: `iot_resource : test-app-xxx` shows that the tagged storage account was created to be tested with the IoT Central App `test-app-xxx`).

These are mainly used for test pipeline debugging and differentiating what resources were created for what runs.

#### Unit and Integration Tests Single Command

Execute the following command to run both Unit and Integration tests and output a code coverage report to the console and to a `.coverage` file.  You can configure code coverage with the `.coveragerc` file.

`pytest -v . --cov=azext_iot --cov-config .coveragerc`

#### Formatting and Linting

The repo uses the linter in `azdev`. For more information, see here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-dev-tools#style-linter-check-and-testing

We use our flake8 and pylint rules. We recommend you set up your IDE as per the VSCode setup below for best compliance.

To manually run pylint with our rules, run this command:

```powershell
pylint azext_iot/ --rcfile=.pylintrc
```

To manually run flake8 with our rules, run this command:

```powershell
flake8 azext_iot/ --statistics --config=setup.cfg
```

We are also starting to use `python black`. To set this up on VSCode, see the following blog post.

https://medium.com/@marcobelo/setting-up-python-black-on-visual-studio-code-5318eba4cd00

## Optional

### VSCode setup

1. Install VSCode

2. Install the required extensions
    * ([ms-python.python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) is recommended)

3. Set up `settings.json`

    ```json
    {
        "python.pythonPath": "path/to/source/env3/Scripts/python.exe",
        "python.venvPath": "path/to/source/",
        "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
        "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
            "path/to/source/env3/Lib/site-packages"
        ],
        "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
        "python.linting.flake8Args": [
            "--config=setup.cfg"
        ],
        "files.associations": {
            "*/.azure-devops/.yml": "azure-pipelines"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Set up `launch.json`

    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Azure CLI Debug (Integrated Console)",
                "type": "python",
                "request": "launch",
                "pythonPath": "${config:python.pythonPath}",
                "program": "${workspaceRoot}/../azure-cli/src/azure-cli/azure/cli/__main__.py",
                "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
                "args": [
                    "--help"
                ],
                "console": "integratedTerminal",
                "debugOptions": [
                    "WaitOnAbnormalExit",
                    "WaitOnNormalExit",
                    "RedirectOutput"
                ],
                "justMyCode": false
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    * launch.json was derived from [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-cli/dev/.vscode/launch.json) file

    * Note: your "program" path might be different if you did not set up the folder structure as siblings as recommended above

    * Note: when passing args, ensure they are all comma separated.

    Correct:

    ```json
    "args": [
        "--a", "value", "--b", "value"
    ],
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```json
    "args": [
        "--a value --b value"
    ],
    ```

5. Set up python black.

6. You should now be able to place breakpoints in VSCode and see execution halt as the code hits them.

### Python debugging

https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html

1. `pip install pdbpp`
2. If you need a breakpoint, put `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` in your code
3. Run your command, it should break execution wherever you put the breakpoint.
