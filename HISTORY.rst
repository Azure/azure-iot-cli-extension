Release History
===============

0.10.0
+++++++++++++++

**IoT Hub updates**

* Add convenience arguments for device update.

**IoT DPS updates**

* Added --show-keys argument to `dps enrollment show` and `dps enrollment-group show` to include full attestation information for symmetric key enrollments and enrollment groups
* Regenerated 2019-03-31 DPS Service SDK

**Breaking Changes**

* `az iot dps enrollment show` and `az iot dps enrollment-group show` now return raw service results instead of deserialized models. 
  This means that some properties that were previously returned as `null` for these commands will no longer be returned, possibly causing a breaking change.


0.9.9
+++++++++++++++

**IoT DPS updates**

* Introduces 'az iot dps compute-device-key' preview command to generate derived device SAS key

**IoT Central updates**

* Introduces 'az iot central diagnostics' preview command group to perform application and device level diagnostics
* Introduces 'az iot central device compute-device-key' preview command to generate derived device SAS key

* This release involves a re-grouping of IoT Central commands.
  
  Set of changes for GA commands
  
  * 'az iot central app device-twin' is deprecated use 'az iot central device twin' instead. Deprecated command group is planned to be removed by December 2020
  * 'az iot central app monitor-events' is deprecated use 'az iot central diagnostics monitor-events' instead. Deprecated command is planned to be removed by December 2020

  Set of changes for preview commands

  * 'az iot central app device registration-summary' moved to 'az iot central diagnostics registration-summary'
  * 'az iot central app monitor-properties' moved to 'az iot central diagnostics monitor-properties'
  * 'az iot central app validate-messages' moved to 'az iot central diagnostics validate-messages'
  * 'az iot central app validate-properties' moved to 'az iot central diagnostics validate-properties'

**IoT Hub updates**

Cloud-to-Device message enhancements

* Introduced new `az iot device c2d-message purge` command to purge the message queue for a device.
* Added message ack arguments to `az iot c2d-message receive` to ack the message after it is received:

  * Options are `--complete`, `--abandon`, and `--reject`, and only one can be used per command.
  * `az iot device c2d-message receive` with no ack arguments remains unchanged and will not ack the message.

Edge device creation enhancements

* Enabled x509 certificate authentication types (`x509_thumbprint` and `x509_ca`) for edge device creation with `az iot hub device-identity create --ee`

Bug fixes

* Fixes issue #243 where providing a connection string via --login still required "az login".

**Digital Twins updates**

The following command groups support passing in a DT instance hostname directly.

  * az dt route
  * az dt model
  * az dt twin

* Like before, if an instance name is provided, the user subscription is first queried for the target instance to retrieve the hostname.
* If a hostname is provided, the subscription query is skipped and the provided value is used for subsequent interaction.


0.9.8
+++++++++++++++
General changes

* Starting with v0.9.8 of the IoT extension, the minCliCoreVersion has been bumped to 2.3.1. This sets a comfortable minimum desired experience we want for our users.
